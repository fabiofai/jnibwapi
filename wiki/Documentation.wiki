JNIBWAPI aims to closely mimic the API of [https://code.google.com/p/bwapi/ BWAPI] (version 3.7.4).

Therefore, *the best place to look for documentation* is in the *[https://code.google.com/p/bwapi/wiki/OldDocumentation BWAPI documentation]*.

If anything in JNIBWAPI does not work as expected according to the BWAPI documentation, please file a bug report on the issues page.

Note: JNIBWAPI currently makes heavy use of IDs where objects are used in BWAPI. This should be remedied soon.
